# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The Chief Data Scientist for PyCity Schools District is in charge of preparing all state-standardized test data for analysis for reporting to help share performance trends and patterns.  These data insights are shared with the school baord and superintendent for decision making at the school level and district level.  The client has reached out for help in the areas of student funding and student standarized test performance to aid in the decision making for school budget and priorities.  This project demonstates my work in aggregating the data and showcasing trends in school performance.

Unfortunetly, after I submitted the analysis the school board sent notice that the files showed academic dishonesty for Thomas High School 9th grade students in math and reading.  As state-testing standards must be upheld the associated student scores should not be calculated into the performance reporting, but must still be reflected in the count for funding consideration.  Therefore, the client is asking for the reports to be run, to look at the extent in which the academic dishonesty affected the reporting and to provide addiquite reporting that reflect state-testing standards to make adequte decisions.

## Mastery Skills demonstrated
This project demonstrates mastery of Python Pandas through: 
- Open Jupyter Notebook files from local directories using a development environment.
- Read an external CSV file into a DataFrame.
- Format a DataFrame column.
- Determine data types of row values in a DataFrame.
- Retrieve data from specific columns of a DataFrame.
- Merge, filter, slice, and sort a DataFrame.
- Apply the groupby() function to a DataFrame.
- Use multiple methods to perform a function on a DataFrame., 
- Perform mathematical calculations on columns of a DataFrame or Series.

- Creating and Activating a Development Environment
- Working with Jupyter Notebook and Pandas
- Converting CSV Files to Pandas DataFrame
- Exploring and Cleaning the Data
- Generating a School District Summary
- Generating a School Summary
- Sort to find the High and Low Performing schools
- Create a new DataFrame from an exsisting DataFrame by:
 - Creating a series by filtering the metaDataFrame
 -  Using groupby function to filter by column
 - Applying the mean() ????? functionORmethod to a column
    - get the average math and for each school
    - get the average reading scores for each school


## Deliverables

### Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores

### Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md)

## Results: Election Outcome Analysis
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data 
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas 
- High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  -- For THS the Math score was XX.XX%, after removing the 9th grade scores affect it was XX.XX%.
  -- For THS the reading score was XX.XX%, after removing the 9th grade scores affect is was XX.XX% with a XX.XX% increase/decrease
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

## Summary: ***Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the nineth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs
After reading and math scores for the 9th grade Thomas High School were replaced with Nans it went from.....   , to .....
