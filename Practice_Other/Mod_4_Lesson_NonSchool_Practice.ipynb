    "# 4.9.3 Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of organizing information in programming. \n",
    "# The class is like the mold (to create the same type of car), and the object is like a particular toy car.\n",
    "# class is used to create a class. \n",
    "#  __init__ method is a special method called a \"class constructor\" that Python calls every time a new instance of the class is created.\n",
    "# This method takes two arguments: self and name. \n",
    " #The self argument refers to a specific Cat object that is created when this method is called. \n",
    "# The second argument, name, will be specified each time a new Cat object is created\n",
    "# an object can hold attributes, and it can also run functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",

    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",

    "# Since it is assigned to the variable first_cat, first_cat.name returns Felix. \n",
